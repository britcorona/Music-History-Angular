# NSS Music History with Angular

### Goal

Create a Music application with the ability to add and delete songs, filter, and view the songs artist and album information.

### Running the Music History application

##### Clone the repo https://github.com/britcorona/Music-History-Angular.git

##### Install the HTTP Server

The http-server module is just a very basic project that will serve static files from the directory of your choice.

sudo npm install -g http-server

##### Serve the application

Next, you go to the Music-History-Angular application root folder and start the server.

*http-server*

http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port it reports it is using) will display the application.

##### Install Bower

Go to the lib folder and *bower install*

##### Install Grunt

Still in the lib folder *npm install*

Now that everything is installed, make sure **Grunt** is running in the *lib folder* and the **http-server** is running the in applications *root folder*, and view the Music History webpage.
